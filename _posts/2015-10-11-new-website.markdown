Welcome to my new website based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

I've often thoght of creating a weblog, but I always end up spending more time developing features for the site, instead of writing actual posts.

### Jekyll & content
I recently started playing around with Jekyll, which is a tool for creating static websites and blogs, which sparked my desire to make a weblog.

As a Software Developer I often spend a lot of time solving different issues regarding programming, and this site will probably be used for writing about how to solve complex issues.

### Under construction
The site is still under construction, which means, that a lot of functions, which blogs usually have, hasn't been implemented yet.
